			<p>My dad has been an inspiration and a teacher for as long as I can remember. Even his experiences prior to my birth, which I have been told of throughout my life, offer wonderful lessons</p>

			<h3>He graduated college when he was still a teenager.</h3>
			<p>My dad has a BS in Electrical Engineering, which he earned at age 19. I can't imagine going through such a difficult program so young. My dad is brilliant, yes, but also hardworking and dedicated. This feat inspires me to <em>work hard in school</em> because I want to make my dad proud. Of course, it also reminds me I have some killer genes, and I sure don't want to waste them!</p>

			<h3>He won my mom over.</h3>
			<p>This is an interesting story. Apparently, my mom had been dating this one gent for two years or so. Let's call him Bill. So my mom's dating Bill and working at GM, or interning or something, and my dad also is working there. He has the hots for my mom and pursues her but gets rejected every time (ouch!). Finally, Mom starts to feel bad for the guy, and agrees to let him come out with her and Bill. It's a double date (Dad brought some lady), and as the night progresses, Bill decides he wants to get drinks. Conveniently, both my parents' dates are of age but my parents are not. Dad seizes the opportunity and offers my Mom a ride home. And... then two weeks later they were engaged and two years later they got married, much to their parents' chagrin. Anyway, what I gleaned from all this is <em>if you want something, go after it</em>. When you do, <em>be persistent</em>, <em>be bold</em>, and <em>don't be afraid to ask</em>.</p>

			<h3>Then they adventured.</h3>
			<p>After my parents got together, they designed a house, started a business, went to Jamaica, did all sorts of things. I want to <em>be an adventurer</em>, too- <em>explore</em>, <em>create</em>, <em>grow</em>, and <em>learn</em>, just like my parents.</p>

			<p>Eventually, I was born, at which point I began personally learning from and being inspired by my dad's example.</p>

			<h3>He makes life fun.</h3>
			<p>Fun has always been important to my dad- most importantly, having fun together. We played sock ball, watched the Three Stooges, made Saturday morning pancakes, had movie nights with a Snack Shack, picked me up from school for lunch, took us on rad family vacations... The list goes on. The point is, my dad is great at making things fun. Boring things like laundry and cleaning day became fun when we added loud music and made it into a competition. The most important thing I learned from my dad about fun is that <em>fun can be made</em>. If you're doing something that isn't inherently fun, or if you're doing something that should be fun but for some reason isn't, make it fun! My dad recently wrote an awesome blog post about happiness, that it can be boiled down to a basic equation: <em>happiness = reality / entitlement</em>. He argues that you can only change how entitled you feel about something in order to increase your happiness score. Fun is similar, but my dad showed me that you can also <em>change your reality</em>. It's a talent I aim to acquire, because he makes life fun for not only himself, but everyone around him as well. And who doesn't love fun?</p>

			<h3>He's a patient listener.</h3>
			<p>People like to be around my dad, not just because of his good looks, either. He's a great listener. My relationship with my mom wasn't always as awesome as it is now, and he used to have to play mediator and translator for us because we miscommunicated all the time. Largely, this was due to the fact that we got emotional and didn't take the time to <em>objectively listen</em> to what the other person was getting at. Enter Dad. He would listen to our troubles separately, patiently, let us get everything on the table, and he would help us <em>understand the real issue</em>. I'm sure he behaved similarly at work, part of the reason he was such a great manager. I strive to be a good listener like my dad is, although I must admit, it isn't easy. I admire him so much for this skill.</p>
