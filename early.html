			<p>My dad has been an inspiration and a teacher for as long as I can remember. Even his experiences prior to my birth, which I have been told of throughout my life, offer wonderful lessons</p>

			<h3>He graduated college when he was still a teenager.</h3>
			<p>My dad has a BS in Electrical Engineering, which he earned at age 19. I can't imagine going through such a difficult program so young. My dad is brilliant, yes, but also hardworking and dedicated. This feat inspires me to <em>work hard in school</em> because I want to make my dad proud. Of course, it also reminds me I have some killer genes, and I sure don't want to waste them!</p>

			<h3>He won my mom over.</h3>
			<p>This is an interesting story. Apparently, my mom had been dating this one gent for two years or so. Let's call him Bill. So my mom's dating Bill and working at GM, or interning or something, and my dad also is working there. He has the hots for my mom and pursues her but gets rejected every time (ouch!). Finally, Mom starts to feel bad for the guy, and she agrees to let him come out with her and Bill. It's a double date (Dad brought some lady), and as the night progresses, Bill decides he wants to get drinks. Conveniently, both my parents' dates are of age but my parents are not. Dad seizes the opportunity and offers my Mom a ride home. And... then two weeks later they were engaged and two years later they were married, much to their parents' chagrin. Anyway, what I gleaned from all this is <em>if you want something, go after it</em>. When you do, <em>be persistent</em>, <em>be bold</em>, and <em>don't be afraid to ask</em>.</p>

			<h3>Then they adventured.</h3>
			<p>After my parents got together, they designed a house, started a business, went to Jamaica, did all sorts of things. I want to <em>be an adventurer</em>, too- <em>explore</em>, <em>create</em>, <em>grow</em>, and <em>learn</em>, just like my parents.</p>
