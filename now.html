			<p>Eventually, I was born, at which point I began personally learning from and being inspired by my dad's example.</p>

			<h3>He makes life fun.</h3>
			<p>Fun has always been important to my dad- most importantly, having fun together. We played sock ball, watched the Three Stooges, made Saturday morning pancakes, had movie nights with a Snack Shack, picked me up from school for lunch, took us on rad family vacations... The list goes on. The point is, my dad is great at making things fun. Boring things like laundry and cleaning day became fun when we added loud music and made it into a competition. The most important thing I learned from my dad about fun is that <em>fun can be made</em>. If you're doing something that isn't inherently fun, or if you're doing something that should be fun but for some reason isn't, make it fun! My dad recently wrote an awesome blog post about happiness, that it can be boiled down to a basic equation: <em>happiness = reality / entitlement</em>. He argues that you can only change how entitled you feel about something in order to increase your happiness score. Fun is similar, but my dad showed me that you can also <em>change your reality</em>. It's a talent I aim to acquire, because he makes life fun for not only himself, but everyone around him as well. And who doesn't love fun?</p>

			<h3>He's a patient listener.</h3>
			<p>People like to be around my dad, not just because of his good looks, either. He's a great listener. My relationship with my mom wasn't always as awesome as it is now, and he used to have to play mediator and translator for us because we miscommunicated all the time. Largely, this was due to the fact that we got emotional and didn't take the time to <em>objectively listen</em> to what the other person was getting at. Enter Dad. He would listen to our troubles separately, patiently, let us get everything on the table, and he would help us <em>understand the real issue</em>. I'm sure he behaved similarly at work, part of the reason he was such a great manager. I strive to be a good listener like my dad is, although I must admit, it isn't easy. I admire him so much for this skill.</p>
