			<p>September 1, 2018 at 8AM, my dad's circruity shut down. His soul left his body. His energy transitioned. However you want to say it.</p>

			<h3>One Year Later</h3>
			<p>I think about my dad every day. I have his signature tattooed on my forearm, so it's pretty difficult not to. I'm not always sad about it, but the strangest things will have this wave of emotions crashing over me. Usually, it's just a couple of waves at a time, not a big storm or anything, but they're fierce. I could spend today focusing on all of the things I've missed about my dad, but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want that kind of lamentation associated with his new adventure. So, let me tell you all of the amazing things that have happened in my life since last September 1.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Northbank Beer Week 3: National Park Edition</em> <p>I got to dress up like a forest ranger and run around to events all week!</p></li>
				<li><em>My First GABF</em> <p>It. Was. Spectacular.</p></li>
				<li><em>The Dream Apartment</em> <p>No kidding. It met all of my criteria. Even the rent!</p></li>
				<li><em>Ms. Deeds</em> <p>I've wanted to be a rockstar since I was little. My dad gave me his Gibson Les Paul when I was a kiddo. There's a picture of 12-year-old Ashley doing a sweet rock jump with it somewhere. This year, I miraculously met Sara and Kat, who needed a bass player, to which I replied: "I can figure that out!" (in a very Akhil-like fashion) We've already played like nine shows. It's so much fun, and I know my dad would have been beyond stoked about it.</p></li>
				<li><em>Pete</em> <p>It felt a lot like my heart died when my dad did. I used to "joke" that it was black before, but then it froze over and went fragile. I got prickly. One of the first times Pete and I hung out, I told him how bullshit relationships are. Because the more you love someone the more it hurts when they go. But.... I guess he's got just the right amount of fire going in my heart, and it's starting to thaw out. He was "Taco Tuesday" at first, and then he became "Taco Everyday". It's wild, y'all. He's funny, and he's smart, and supportive and kind and attentive and nurturing and driven. He's a dreamer, a traveler, an artist... And slowly he is helping me grow. He's my PIC, my main man, my sex machine, my rockstar lover... I'm crazy about him.</p></li>
				<li><em>Holly</em> <p>Have you ever wondered what sunshine incarnate would look like? It's Holly. She was originally known to me as "PDXbeergir", her beer blogging alter-ego. I wanted to be her friend early on, but, girls are scary, especially when they're fun and pretty and popular. (My fourth grade self resurfaces.) I invited her to Spring Brewfest, which we ended up bailing on quite early and instead ate tacos and talked for two hours. Then, we just kept talking. At first it was all beer stuff, but now, it's everything. She's my best friend. We send video messages to each other all day every day. We porch-sit and smoke joints and drink beer and dance and blow bubbles and have work-from-home-Tuesdays togather. (Apparently, Tuesdays are really good days for me.) I couldn't tell you the last time I had a friend like Holly. She's so sweet, supportive, detail-oriented, upbeat, energetic, sharp, funny... She is definitely my sunshine, and I am so happy to have her in my world.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>There's so much more, but this is the highlight reel</h3>
			<p>I love my dad more than anything in the whole world. I regret the last few months we had together often, because I feel like I was unkind and didn't love on him enough - not even close to enough. But, when those thoughts start to invade my brain, I remind myself of this exersize my dad taught me:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make a "T" with your arms.</li>
				<li>Point your index fingers to the sky.</li>
				<li>Look at both of your fingers at the same time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can't. That's the point. On the one hand, you have positivity: a bright future, hope, silver linings, faith... And on the other, negativity: self doubt, hate, anger, self pity.... You can only focus on one at a time. So, when you feel your head starting to turn, your perspective starting to darken, remember that you can always return to face the light. <b>That's the Akhil spirit.</b></p>
